- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests
- **FormData**: For handling multipart/form-data requests with file uploads
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized code structure for maintainability and extensibility

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or pnpm
- Google Chrome (for Puppeteer)
- Active WhatsApp account
- Internet connection

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd WhatsAppBot
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure the bot
Edit the `config.js` file to set your API endpoint and other configurations:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  API_BASE_URL: "http://your-api-endpoint.com",
  // Other configuration options...
}
```

### 4. Start the bot
```bash
npm start
```
On first run, you'll need to scan the generated QR code with your WhatsApp mobile app to authenticate.

## Commands
The bot responds to the following commands:

- `!help` - Display help information and list of commands
- `!login` - Log in to your account (with location sharing)
- `!profile` - View your user profile information
- `!reportemergency` - Report an emergency situation
- `!nearbydisasters` - Check for disasters near your location
- `!monitordisasters` - Start monitoring for new disasters near your location with automatic alerts
- `!stopmonitoring` - Stop the active disaster monitoring for your location
- `!logout` - Log out from your account
- `!cancel` - Cancel the current operation

## Architecture

The bot follows a modular architecture with these key components:

- `main.js`: Entry point that initializes the WhatsApp client and sets up event handlers
- `handlers/`: Command-specific handlers for different user interactions
- `api/`: API client for communication with the backend disaster management system
- `utils/`: Utility functions for formatting messages and handling location data
- `config.js`: Configuration settings for the bot

## Benefits

### For Disaster Management Authorities
- **Real-time Information**: Receive first-hand reports from affected areas
- **Enhanced Coordination**: Better coordinate rescue and relief operations
- **Wide Reach**: Leverage WhatsApp's extensive user base for maximum coverage
- **Resource Optimization**: Prioritize responses based on urgency levels
- **Visual Verification**: Receive images to verify reported emergencies

### For Communities and Individuals
- **Easy Access**: No need for specialized appsâ€”use the familiar WhatsApp interface
- **Quick Reporting**: Report emergencies with essential details in a guided process
- **Stay Informed**: Check for nearby disasters to make safety decisions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring for new disasters in your area and receive immediate alerts when new emergencies are detected
- **Reduced Response Time**: Direct line to emergency services through WhatsApp
- **Low Data Usage**: Works efficiently even with limited connectivity

## Development

### Extending the Bot
The modular architecture makes it easy to add new commands:

1. Create a new handler in the `handlers/` directory
2. Add the command logic to handle user interactions
3. Register the new command in `commandHandler.js`

### Security Considerations
- User authentication is managed through secure tokens
- Personal data is only stored temporarily during the session
- Location data is only requested when necessary for disaster-related functions
